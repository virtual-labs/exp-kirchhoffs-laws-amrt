## Assignment



1. A car battery is of 12 V. Eight dry cells of 1.5 V each connected in series can give 12 V. But such cells are not used in starting a car. Why?
2. In the following circuit, a battery of emf 6 V and internal resistance 0.5 Ω is joined in parallel with another battery of 10 V and internal resistance 1 Ω. The combination sends a current through an external resistance of 12 Ω. Find the current through each battery.
