      "question": "Which circuit law states that the sum of all currents into and out of a node equals zero?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Norton's Current Law.",
        "b": "Chebyshev's Current Law.",
        "c": "Kirchhoff's Current Law.",
        "d": "Lenz's Current Law."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect; Norton's theorem relates to equivalent circuits.",
        "b": "Incorrect; Chebyshev's law is unrelated to circuits.",
        "c": "Correct. Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) applies to nodes.",
        "d": "Incorrect; Lenz's law deals with electromagnetic induction."

      "question": "__________ carries negative charge and ____________ carries positive charge.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Proton, Electron",
        "b": "Electron, Proton",
        "c": "Neutron, Electron",
        "d": "Nucleus, Electron"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect; proton is positive, electron is negative.",
        "b": "Correct. Electron = negative, Proton = positive.",
        "c": "Neutrons are neutral.",
        "d": "The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; not a single particle."

      "question": "In a circuit, the current is directly proportional to __________.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Voltage",
        "b": "Resistance",
        "c": "Temperature",
        "d": "Resistivity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Ohm’s Law: I ∝ V (I = V/R).",
        "b": "Incorrect; current is inversely proportional to resistance.",
        "c": "Incorrect; not directly related unless specified context (e.g. semiconductors).",
        "d": "Incorrect; resistivity affects resistance, not directly current."
